## 1. Decisions
With Python and Django, it is possible to achieve good performance and a range of simplified data manipulations and handling using basic data structures. It is also equally simple to generate data analysis and create dashboards in the future.
React allows rendering interfaces in a very dynamic way, which meets the simplest scenario that was designed, but will also cater to future more complex data display implementations.
The solution focuses on being as simple as possible using data structures that do not require much manipulation or excessive use of libraries. This improves cost and time complexity.

## 2. Changes in Columns
As the project uses dictionaries, which are easily expandable data structures, adding columns would not bring much complexity in implementation.

## 3. Changes to Generate CSV
A form can be created on the front end to receive the data, and a new functionality on the back end can receive this list of data and return a formatted CSV.

## 4. Total Time Spent
I spent around 3 hours to develop the entire project.
